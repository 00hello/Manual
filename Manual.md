# Who are we

We are an early-stage investment fund that backs and builds companies. We are Dan Strickland, James Cham, Karin Klein, Roy Bahat, and Shivon Zilis.

# What we want

We want every company we back or build to have a shot at being extraordinary, and as many as possible to live up to that promise. 

We want to invent new ways of creating companies, suited to the speed and unpredictability of technology. We want to live on the frontier of experiments in new models for entrepreneurship, use of capital, leadership, and the nature of work generally.

We hope our companies support each other, with the same respect that we as a team have for them.

If the companies don’t succeed, we hope they treat their people, their users, their partners, and their founders well. We hope they learn, and we do.

# Why we exist

Bloomberg L.P. is our sole investor. They wanted a window onto the world of early-stage companies, and a way to support them and collaborate with them that doesn’t involve a direct business partnership. (Many startups are not ready to partner with Bloomberg -- or any established, larger company -- until they’ve grown, settled on a direction, and decided to make a partnership a priority. That can take as long as a few years after the company is founded.) 

Bloomberg L.P. invested in Bloomberg Beta to open that window to startups, and set it up with a structure -- a true fund that invests for financial return, not an “operating division” -- because they know that great entrepreneurs want investors whose interests are fully aligned with their own.

So Bloomberg Beta is set up to choose its own investments, and -- within areas of interest to Bloomberg -- back companies solely on their merits, regardless of whether they have (or intend to have) a business relationship with Bloomberg. 

We appreciate many things about our investor: Bloomberg knows and respects technology and technology companies, is set up to be independent-minded, and build with long-term value in mind. Bloomberg was created 30 years ago on a then-controversial idea -- that information in financial markets should be more widely shared. While Bloomberg has reached global scale and influence, it’s still held by its founders. 

# How we support our companies

We aspire to be the most useful investors per minute spent with us. 

We prefer to take the formality out of the investor / entrepreneur relationship.  Rather than requesting board seats and scheduling monthly calls, we share with entrepreneurs and encourage them to reach out to us when we can help.  Consider us 'on speed dial'.


## Areas where we tend to be most useful

While we’re happy to help companies across the full range of early-stage company questions -- recruiting, fundraising (should I take more money or call it a day?), services (who do I use for HR?) -- we have a concentration in the range of skills loosely called “going to market.” To us, that includes finding product-market fit, using the various organic marketing tools, paid marketing, press, partnerships, planning to raise more capital, and just the overall understanding of the importance of communicating who you are and why you are.

We have presence in both SF and NYC.  We've found that SF based entrepreneurs often need a helping hand with east coast customers / operations and vice versa.  We make a concerted effort to help the transition from 'west to east' and 'east to west'.  We like to think of ourselves and building the bridge from the Bay Area to NYC.

We don’t usually ask for “general updates”, but we do spring into action when called. We adjust the intensity of how often we’re in touch with a company based on what we believe would be useful to them -- and we take feedback from companies on what they want. Some of our companies have asked us to do monthly, or even weekly, meetings with them, others “go into hiding” while working on their product -- we’re good either way.

Because we may be building our own products, we are current on tactical trends and know them firsthand. It also means that we don’t need to spend time with you for the sake of “being active” -- and we try to empathize. We don’t believe that investors and entrepreneurs are fundamentally different -- they may face different risks and questions, and have different interests, but we’re all just trying to spark something great in this big wide world.

## How we like to work with you

We don’t have a standard model. There are some cases where most of our communication with a company is by IM, others where we do a regularly-scheduled call, others where we meet for coffee from time to time -- it just depends on what the entrepreneur wants.

We appreciate getting regular investment updates (e.g., a monthly email) from our companies, since it creates a background of good understanding that helps us help you. In practice, about two-thirds of our portfolio companies are in this habit.

What’s even better than an update intended for investors, is some passive way for you to keep us updated (i.e., something that requires no incremental work). If they send a weekly internal update, copying us is great; if they use a team collaboration tool (Yammer, Trello, Basecamp, a Skype chat, etc.) we’d love to be included and take it as a great sign of trust; we have even subscribed to the private Github repo of one of our portfolio companies.

## Each other

Now that we are beginning to have a critical mass of companies in our portfolio, the companies can be helpful to each other -- vendor referrals, emotional support, product tips, etc. Today we do this informally, but we’d like to use better tools to enable this as we grow.

## Learning

We recognize that founders don’t have the time to plan for their own professional growth and learning, so we offer them some of that. We might do a training on how to create useful communication with technical teams, or invite entrepreneurs to a panel on a subject we think they might care about.

## Events we host

Sometimes, one way we can help companies is just by getting them out of the building and having a good time. We get our entrepreneurs together every so often with an extended group of our friends. These events are completely optional, and have no direct usefulness at all. The last two we did were building robots at TechShop and learning to make cocktails with the head of SF Mixology.


## Company feedback on us

We intend at the end of every year to ask all our entrepreneurs (and anyone on their teams who feels comfortable) to do a short (under 10 minutes) anonymous survey to give us feedback on what we can do better. Always be learning from your customers -- ours are entrepreneurs.

## After the exit...

We haven’t gotten to do this part yet, but we intend to be disciplined about learning from every company. We will write up a retrospective report where we evaluate our value added to the team -- vs. what we wish we could have added. We assess whether we were right on the risks the company faced, and what lessons we learned. Most important, we ask whether the entrepreneur would have asked for our money again.

We will also do a post-investment survey from the entrepreneur.

## How to make the most of us

What gets us going is helping companies realize their potential. We are happiest when we are “in it” with you, whiteboarding a set of features, pushing back on your plan to announce your fancy new product release, or getting that late night call that you think things aren’t working out with the person you just spent six months to recruit. We feed off your enthusiasm, and hope to help you build even more of it.

Investing, to us, is really just the mechanism we use to find a way to work with you.  We'd much rather be getting our hands dirty down in the trenches than bestowing wisdom from an ivory tower


# What we look for in a potential investment

We recognize that seeing early signs of greatness is hard, and nobody’s cracked how to do it reliably. That said, there are a few things we do look for: certain qualities of a founding team, an early product, and a moment in a company’s life.

We are generally open to a fairly broad range of themes, though we’ve made a concerted effort to rule out several that we feel require special attention and expertise.  We think choosing blind spots is very necessary as you can’t be all things to all people, so we won’t invest in places where we don’t feel we can be particularly useful.  That being said we like to keep an open mind about emerging trends so our window of focus changes over time.


## Founders

We look for a reason to believe a founding team is extraordinary. Not that they have the perfect skills or experiences to match the business they want to build (which is where the “team” slide in the deck tends to focus), but that they have the capacity for greatness.

So much of backing founders is about trust -- many of the companies we’ve backed are led by people who we’ve known for years, and grown to trust. If we don’t know you ourselves, we prefer if someone we trust knows you. Otherwise we find it hard to trust our impressions of you after a meeting or two; first impressions are so unreliable. That said, we’ve backed entrepreneurs who we only just met -- sometimes you “just know.”

We have passed on companies because we didn’t think the founders were crazy enough -- because they seemed too textbook.

## Product

We prefer to see products that dominate some initial market, over products that grow to large numbers but don’t play an important role in the lives of their users. We like for a product to be the most important service in the life of at least some of its users.

We like products that we ourselves would use and understand. We’ve been technology buyers, software developers, entrepreneurs, entry-level employees, and of course consumers of many types of media -- so the range of products we might use and understand is broad.

If a product is launched, we care about how well it is doing -- the famous “traction” -- but we tend not to focus on absolute numbers. We focus on month-over-month (or, in earlier-stage cases, week-over-week) growth, ask questions about how different cohorts of users behave, and try to understand the per-user behavior (how much does any one user really value the product).

## Stage

We strongly prefer to be the first money into a company. This isn’t so much a rational investment calculation (arguably there is less competition to write bigger, later checks) -- but it’s a matter of our style. This just happens to be what we like. We make exceptions when there is some other good reason (an entrepreneur or company we just couldn’t resist).

## Geography

Since we prefer working closely with our companies, we are heavily biased toward investing in companies we can see in person. That means San Francisco and New York since we have people in both of those cities.  Our team has deep roots in both places so our knowledge of the areas and ability to bring in local folks that can help are greater there.  This isn’t to say that we won’t consider an investment elsewhere (Palo Alto!), but we’re very careful to choose companies where we can be disproportionately helpful, and being local is a very real part of that. 

We have invested outside of San Francisco and New York a couple of times (San Mateo!), though it is rare, and we have yet to invest in a company outside the United States. 

## Sources

We find investments in many ways, but our favorite is for companies to be referred by entrepreneurs we have already backed.

After that, we are most likely to invest in companies that come to us through someone we trust. Several of those have come our way through referrals from the staff at Bloomberg L.P. -- this creates an instant “customer reference,” often from someone whose judgment we respect.

We don’t really find companies, we mostly find entrepreneurs. We tend to ask people we trust who are the 1-2 most exceptional people you’ve met, whether in school or at work, or in some other way -- and then we get to know those people. We hope that some of those people evolve to be great entrepreneurs, and we’d like to know them whether or not they do.

We also read, a lot. And we reach out to people and companies that we read about.

We track every company we’ve been in touch with -- including cold inbound emails.

## “Themes”

Our overall focus is investing in companies that improve work -- these can be individual-facing (not all “enterprise”) so long as they help a person be more productive, knowledgeable, or content at work. Of course they can also be services for businesses.

We can invest in the following areas, all of which are of great interest to Bloomberg L.P.: data, technology platforms, media distribution, content discovery, networks & communities, human-computer interaction, and radically new organizational models. It’s a wide range.

We avoid investments in financial services. While it is fine for us to back ventures that compete with Bloomberg L.P., we never want to back a venture that intends to compete with a Bloomberg client.

We have mixed views on our team about the importance of our own ideas (i.e., some of us are more thesis focused, some more founder focused). We’ve found that the best entrepreneurs can surprise an investor with a completely unexpected take -- and prompt the investor to see a category anew.

That said, we do have some specific themes we currently care about:
* Networks & communities: Connecting professional networks other than office workers (especially those where most of the work is in mobile contexts)
* New organizational models: Bringing software development methodologies to other applications (e.g., version control for the real world); design as a differentiator; unbundling of corporations
* Human-computer interaction: Hardware companies with network effects
* Media distribution: Over-the-top television
* Content discovery: Self-development through professional skill development
* Technology platforms: Exploiting the increasing power of the browser, and WebRTC in particular
* Data: Vertical applications and analytical tools that affect business decisions

We find it hard to imagine we’d make an investment in ecommerce or entertainment.

### How to reach out to us

If you don’t know how to find us, you don’t know how to use the Internet and you should probably rethink whether being an entrepreneur is the right career for you.

Should you send us a cold email? Probably not. If we were a customer of yours, would you cold email us? Wouldn’t you rather try to find someone in common? Ideally, it’s an entrepreneur we invested in already, someone we trust in our professional networks, or someone at Bloomberg L.P. who knows you well. If you have to resort to a cold email, which great people sometimes do, at least show us that you took the time to exhaust the available sources of information first. Write an interesting headline. Tell us you read this. sentence. right. here.

# How we decide

We have an “anyone can say yes” policy. No, you don’t have to meet my other partners. We believe the best entrepreneurs and companies are polarizing. Each of our partners hopes to feel perplexed by why another partner fell in love with your company. We also believe in individual accountability -- if anyone can say yes, then everyone feels the weight of making a decision.

Nothing makes us happier than when one partner pounds the pavement about an investment.  History shows that when there is consensus (either all partners agree, or all partners disagree) investments tend to not outperform.  Our team is purposely diverse in terms of interests and backgrounds.  Through both that diversity and our atypical decision making process we hope to find rare opportunities others may have missed.

That said, we value each others’ opinions and seek them out. We talk as a full group twice a week, to think out loud about companies we’ve invested in or might invest in, and we meet for a full day once every couple of months.  Since our team has different skills and networks, it's often in the best interest of the entrepreneur to meet multiple parties to get a better understanding of how we can help.

When we think about companies, we find ourselves asking questions like:
* Why do we believe this company has a shot at doing something unusual and disruptive?
* How do we like the product or, if the product isn’t yet built, the planned approach?  Do we think users will *love* the product?  Will they like it enough to convince their closest friends / colleagues to use it?
* Do we really believe we understand this product or team better than others?
* How useful can we really be to this company -- are we “just a check” -- and if the company succeeds, how likely is it that we’ll be able to continue to support them?
* When will the company need more capital, and what will it need to accomplish before it can earn that capital?

We’ve had investments where the entrepreneur only ever met one person on our team before we invested (though, afterward we all want to meet our companies so we can help them). In practice, each of us often asks a company if they’d like to meet one of our other colleagues because the entrepreneur will get a better feel for us, and because we like and respect our colleagues (almost all of the time).

## “The Deck”

A demo is 50 times more useful than a deck. Product is our sustenance; feed us.

We don’t like the idea of entrepreneurs spending lots of time making presentations. When we see “v36” in the filename of a presentation, it terrifies us. That said, we do value the work entrepreneurs do writing down their plans for their company, because it gives us a sense of:
* How the team thinks
* How well the team communicates 
* Whether, if we don’t know the team, we should spend the time to meet in person

There is no standard format we like, but we probably spend 2-5 minutes reading a deck when we are deciding whether to meet a company. In roughly [one-fifth] of our portfolio companies, we never saw a deck before investing -- usually because the product spoke so loudly for itself, or we knew the team and business so well we didn’t need a deck.

We don’t believe, in most cases, that a long-term financial model makes much sense for a day-zero startup to build -- except to show what the “unit economics” (revenue and cost from a single user or customer) need to be for the business to work. If you can’t cook up assumptions that make the overall business wildly profitable in a few years, then you probably should be doing something else for a living.

That said, we do care about the short-term financial plan. How many people do you intend to hire, where will you spend the money? This helps us figure out how much time you will have before you need more capital, and how far we believe you can get in that amount of time.

Put another way, a five-year financial plan is mostly useless -- a monthly plan for the next six months and a quarterly plan for the next two years could be very useful.

## In-person meetings

Once we’re meeting in person, you can often leave the laptop closed. We’re trying to get a sense of you as a founder, ask you hard questions and see how you respond.

Some things we tend to say, ask, or think in meetings:
* We act more like an individual angel investor in many ways than a fund. More like a “CEO who invests” -- because we both build and invest in companies, because we’ve all done honest work for a living, and because we always enjoyed the CEO-investors who backed companies and found them to be incredibly valuable per minute spent.
* We don’t put great faith in the value of advice, including our own -- the world of users and customers has more to teach a company than any smart, well-intentioned person.
* What makes you an outlier? 

At any point, we’d be happy to narrate for you our level of interest -- though you might not always like what you hear. (And remember, an 80% chance of wanting to work together still means there is a 20% chance we will not want to work together.)

Immediately after we meet, a frequent thing we need to do is just think on it -- if we find ourselves getting less excited a day or two later, that’s probably a bad sign. If we find ourselves returning to the conversation in our heads, wondering what you meant when you said such-and-such, and imagining how great the product will be, that’s a wonderful sign.

A lot of entrepreneurs wonder why investors don’t get back to them quickly. This is a crappy pattern, and one we’ve been guilty of from time to time. Sometimes, the reason is we’re doing work on your company (e.g., calling references, who might take a few days to get back themselves). Sometimes it’s that we’re not sure and we’re giving ourselves a few days to see if we get more excited or less as we think on it more. Sometimes we just mess up and forget to reply. It’s not OK when that happens.

## “Doing the work” and calling references

If we decide we are going to invest, we often (but not always) go through a short cycle of working on our own view -- probing for holes in our own thinking, asking the advice of our one friend who has been thinking about this industry for 10 years, understanding other approaches that have been tried (or are current competitors), and spending as much time as we can using the product. Many of the same kinds of things we find that entrepreneurs do in the early days of contemplating creating a new company.

During this period, we’re careful to be open with the entrepreneur about whether we will call around to ask about them. We put great faith in the value of these reference calls, and we owe a debt to the friends, colleagues, and partners who are willing to share open, unvarnished views. We try to skip nonsense questions (“what are their strengths and weaknesses”) and instead focus on things that will help us decide whether to back a founder:
* How does this person compare to other founders you’ve known? Top 10%? 5%? 1%?
* What makes you believe this person is extraordinary?
* If you were us, and decided to invest in the company, what areas would you guess this person would need the most help?

We call as many references as we can find.

## Our deal memo

Before we invest, we write a “note to self” outlining our views. We do this so we can be as disciplined about our commitments as entrepreneurs are about their commitments. We also share this note with an advisory group at Bloomberg L.P. that includes four senior leaders of the company.

In order of importance, we write about:
* The founders’ vision
* Our thoughts on the founding team, and what our diligence calls revealed (including how we met the team)
* Why we are excited about the company
* If the product is built, what we think of it and how well it is doing
* Whether Bloomberg L.P. can help the company and whether the company, in success, could create benefits for Bloomberg L.P. (this is not a criterion for investing, but something we want to know -- to best realize that opportunity later)
* What we believe the company needs to do to succeed (or make the next major milestone, like a further round of funding)
* The terms of the deal
* Other stuff: Competition, Market size (to the extent we can tell), business model (in our experience it is usually either unknowable or obvious, and not worth much mental energy either way)

## How long it takes

We’ve made investment decisions in the first meeting (though usually when we already knew the entrepreneur and something about what they are working on), and we’ve had cases where we get to know the entrepreneur over a period of weeks or months and watch their business evolve (often paying a higher price as we watch the entrepreneur make progress). 

### Our “Service-Level Agreement”

Some firms commit to giving you an answer in a certain amount of time. We commit that at any point in time, if you ask us to narrate the likelihood of investment and timeframe, we’ll tell you. 

The reason we don’t have a guideline like “3 meetings in two weeks” is because that smells like a transaction, and we’d rather be in a long-term relationship with you. Many of our investments have evolved out of months or years of conversation with an entrepreneur, much of which started before Bloomberg Beta even existed. Yes, some are love at first sight. We’re not sure which will turn out better. But would you tell someone on the first date how many times you had to date them before you decided whether to get married? It’s fundamentally unpredictable at first, but it does become clear quickly.

If you’re in a conversation with us, our policy is “do ask, do tell” -- we will always share with you our current sense of excitement and timing. You might have to make a decision, and we want you to know where we stand. If the elevator doors close while we are thinking on it, so be it.

We intend to always give a clear “no” with straightforward reasoning. That reasoning, while straightforward, might still be subjective (“we just didn’t get excited about this and we’re not sure why”).

## How much risk do we take

Since we bet early, and expect the vast majority of our portfolio companies to fail to return much money, our winners need to be big. We fully expect that, if we succeed, one investment we make will return our entire fund. So we need to believe that every company could be that investment. 

We prefer enormous growth in modest markets to modest growth in enormous markets.

# How we think about “the deal”

Our goal, particularly with first-time founders, is to explain what we want and why in plain language. We want to act in a way where, if our asks were widely publicized, we’d be proud of them.

## “Control”

We are not big fans of boards in day-zero companies. While we like entrepreneurs having a close circle of trusted colleagues to ask for advice, when we imagine early-stage entrepreneurs working on slide decks instead of products, it makes us feel a little ill. We also feel that the cadence of board review (every couple of months, let’s say) isn’t well matched to the cadence of a day-zero company (which evolves every week or two). Later on, boards can be great. If people don’t talk just to hear themselves talk, which each of us has been guilty of now and again.

More generally, we are ambivalent about whether investor control is useful at all. We’ve seen it cut both ways.

So, we generally prefer not to have a seat on a company’s board. But, that said, if the company wants us on the board, we’re open to talking about it. We have yet to take a board seat in any of our investments.

## Rights we want

We care about getting “pro rata” rights. If you don’t know what these are, this means that if an entrepreneur offers another investor the opportunity to invest at a certain price, we want to invest at that price too -- at least up to the amount needed to preserve our ownership of the company.

We care about getting some information rights -- basically the ability for us to understand how well the company is doing, whether through product metrics or financials.

## The numbers

Our standard maximum for a first check is $250,000. We have no minimum check size, and have written checks as small as $25,000. That said, if we like a company, we generally prefer to write a $250,000 check. Although our fund can comfortably write much bigger checks, we believe that the early days of funds, just like the early days of companies, should burn capital more slowly while they find product-market fit. As we mature, we may become more rigid in our financial requirements for deals as we learn what works for us, and we will write bigger checks.

We care about price. We do not have a target ownership level, but would like to see a path where we can put more money into a company and own a meaningful amount of the company. Our view is that we are comfortable taking the highest possible levels of risk and that entrepreneurs, and their investors, should be rewarded for that.

We also believe “the price is the price” -- we won’t bake in any unusual discounts for ourselves with strange terms like participating preferred equity. We don’t mind whether our investment is structured as a note or as equity.

We believe in transparency. If a startup that took our money wants to publicize the terms of our investment, we’d generally support that. 

The average price of our deals in the first six months of 2012 was [$6.8M.] (This average includes only our investments in the first round of capital in companies -- we could not figure out a way to make later-stage investments comparable on an apples-to-apples basis.)

While we’d like to claim that the amount of work we do on behalf of a company will vary dramatically based on our ownership interest, we’re not sure that is true yet -- the reality is that the amount of work we do for a company depends most of all on how much the company needs and wants our help. If they ask us to work for them, we generally do all we can.

## Other investors

We don’t care whether we are the lead investor or not. We have invested in situations where we are the only investor, and we have invested in situations where we own such a miniscule percentage of a company that it rounds to zero.

We do care who a company’s other investors are, because the investors form an extended team around a company -- and we want our companies to have the best teams possible. We get concerned when we see situations with many investors, none of whom have a significant stake, because we worry that none will actually work to help the company.

## Following on

Because we have a relatively big fund ($75M) for writing modest initial checks, we do plan to devote an unusually large proportion of our fund’s resources to following on. We won’t follow on in every investment, but if we are excited about putting in more money we might want to follow on for 5x our initial investment -- or more. 

If asked, we’re happy to be explicit about the conditions under which we’d ask to put more capital into a company.

## “Standard terms”

We believe investors should get a “1x liquidation preference” -- in other words, if the company ends up being worth less than the value that we invested at, we should be able to at least get our money back.

We want to protect your confidentiality and ours.

# Different “products” we offer

We think of our “products” as offerings of support and capital to a company, and the price we charge is ownership in a company.

## “First Seed”

Our preference is to be the first money into a company, and to contribute a meaningful amount of capital. We want to be able to add capital, often increasing our ownership stake, as the company evolves. This is the core of what we do, and it reflects roughly [four-fifths] of the investments we’ve made.

## “Flag”

In some cases, we can only put a small amount of money to work (for example, in rounds where the entrepreneur is fortunate to have many investors who want to support the company), and it is unlikely we can invest more. In these cases, our support is as much symbolic as it is financial -- we want to be part of something, even though we know it is unlikely to be an investment that is meaningful to our fund financially.

## “[X?]”

We may do selected later-stage investments where we think we have an unusual insight or ability to contribute. The bar is much higher for how confident we have to be in these companies, given their higher valuations and our generally lower ownership. This is almost always in the case of an entrepreneur whose company we have watched, and perhaps already been helping, for quite some time.

## “Founder Seed”

Last, we seek out opportunities to create companies. We are fundamentally entrepreneurs, and sometimes want to see something in the world and do not see another team working to build what we believe should exist. So, in these cases, we try to form a team and go after it ourselves. How does this work? We partner with a CEO we know to form a new company, which the founders control -- but for which we commit to play an unusually large role. From the perspective of the founders, we feel like another founder (although one who also brings “you can quit your day job” capital). In these situations, we may earn regular founder common stock (which vests, in case the founders ever want to fire us) -- in addition to our financial investment.

## How we work with Bloomberg L.P.

We look for opportunities to connect startups (including our portfolio companies and others) with Bloomberg L.P. -- we invest significant time in understanding what Bloomberg may be interested in seeing. In practice, we refer more companies to Bloomberg that are not our portfolio companies, than are our portfolio companies. And only [one-third] of our portfolio companies have an active relationship today with Bloomberg.

We invest for financial return only, and -- while we look for value that Bloomberg L.P. can create for startups and vice versa -- we select companies independently of whether they have any business relationship with Bloomberg. 

We have an extended Advisory Committee at Bloomberg L.P. that includes the CEO, Chairman, [Title], [Title]. That group hears from us about common themes we see, gives us input and feedback, and approves big checks.

# Caveats entrepreneurs should know

Things not to try on us, that others have tried:
* A first email that says “My round is closing next week. Do you have interest?” We have no fear of the elevator doors closing on us, and we understand that entrepreneurs are all pressed for time.
* “You can only try our product if you invest.” If the product isn’t ready, we understand that. But if it is ready and we can’t play with it, we don’t like that. Products are our nourishment, don’t starve us.

We will not invest in a company that is a known competitor today to one of our portfolio companies. We find out whether that’s the case by (a) warning the entrepreneur that we may have a conflict, and letting them decide whether to spend time with us or share information and (b) if we consider investing, asking our portfolio company how they think about that general area.

That said, we recognize that companies’ focus evolves and that our portfolio companies may come to be in competition. If that happens, we commit to asking both entrepreneurs (and boards, if relevant) what they prefer we do and maximizing for our portfolio companies’ interests -- not our own. If that means selling our stake back to one of the companies at a fair price, for example, we will do that.

Like many other investors and entrepreneurs, we generally don’t sign NDAs -- though we do agree to non-disclosure and other confidentiality provisions in companies once we decide to invest in them.

## Our team 

We have a remarkably low level of normal team dysfunction. Because any one of us is empowered to “yes” a deal, we all share and share alike on helping each others’ deals succeed. “Before the investment, it’s your deal; after the investment, it’s our deal.”

We intend to keep our team about where it is -- we’re not convinced growing the size of our team would help us at this stage.

Like a startup, we’re burning our capital slowly at first while we find product-market fit. In our case, our product is our offering to entrepreneurs. We are optimizing at this stage for being involved with the best founders and the best companies, and more flexible on the precise structure for our involvement (check size, stage, level of involvement).

# Thank you

We all move fast, and prefer to spend our time on things that matter. So if you read this, and if you spend time with us, we hope that -- whether or not we work together -- you find it worth it.
