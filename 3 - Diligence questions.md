Diligence Questions
========

What are our criteria for selecting an investment? Investments we want to make go beyond a checklist of “box ticking” on our non-negotiable requirements (e.g., that we trust the founders). We look for important indicators that can bias us for or against investing, but to pass, startups need the potential to be more than merely great, they need a shot at the extraordinary. The good news is that to do that, we only look for at least one reason to believe, at whatever stage the company is at, that it can be an outlier...

# Founder(s) and Team
##### Reason to believe it's a potential outlier
+ Ever do something singular? Record of unusual achievement
+ Best-in-the-world experience in the domain
+ Punch-way-above-your-weight first hires
+ Depth of commitment to the problem ("would do this for a decade, and keep going even if funding never appeared")

##### Important indicators
+ Combination of human / inhuman
+ Presence of cognitive distortions of founders
+ Reaction to intense pressure or strong criticism?
+ Differentiated value proposition for talent
+ If business shows early signs of success, can founders go the distance?

##### Non-negotiable requirements
+ Trustworthy (i.e., will tell us when things are even a little broken)
+ Can raise more money, or get business to profitability
+ Completed background check
+ In Bay Area or New York (and, if not, strong reason to believe we are the best possible investor)

# Product and market
##### Reason to believe it's a potential outlier
+ Never-heard-before insight into the market or problem
+ A wow of a product experience (including our own personal experience with it)
+ Extreme early numbers, especially on engagement (though could be on growth)
+ Customers are evangelists, especially if paying full price

##### Important indicators
+ Someone else already tried -- good sign!
+ Clear initial target market, surprisingly narrow, and high on the gradient of influence
+ Clear single metric to focus on now (often engagement or satisfaction)
+ Ignoring the business fashions of the moment
+ Ability to create a #1 service in its market (e.g., network effects, customer lock-in)
+ Could be most important product to its users
+ We have a unique ability to help
+ Clear sense, if applicable, of any direct competitors and why the company has superior offering for its market

##### Non-negotiable requirements
+ "Makes business work better", without being in financial services
+ We have judgment to identify a winner in the relevant market (usually means a fit with one of our stated investment areas)
+ Unlikely to compete directly with our other portfolio companies

# Business and economics
##### Reasons to believe it's a potential outlier
+ Surprisingly profitable unit economics

##### Important indicators
+ Clear sense of why to raise capital (i.e., where to deploy)
+ Clear sense of why to raise venture capital (we often discourage founders from taking venture at all)

##### Non-negotiable requirements
+ Plausible to have sustainable unit economics in the future

# Deal terms
##### Reasons to believe it's a potential outlier
+ None. [Good deal terms are never a reason to invest in and of themselves]

##### Important indicators
+ Founders own enough of the company
+ Fair ratio between risk and reward?
+ Pro rata rights
+ Information rights, especially to financials
+ Other investors can help the company succeed
+ In success, our eagerness to invest many multiples of our original investment

##### Non-negotiable requirements
+ Standard investor protections (i.e., liquidity preference at 1x, blocking right over investments that would get repaid before we do)
