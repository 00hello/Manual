Investor Checklist
========

What are our criteria for selecting an investment? Investments we want to make go beyond a checklist of “box ticking” on our non-negotiable requirements (e.g., that we trust the founders). To pass, startups need the potential to be more than merely great, they need a shot at the extraordinary. The good news is that to do that, we only look for at least one reason to believe, at whatever stage the company is at, that it can be an outlier...

||(Not a checklist!)  Reason to believe it’s a potential outlier: need at least one of the below to be extraordinary, compared to other great startups at the same stage|Important indicators: any of these can bias us for or against investing|(Checklist!) Non-negotiable requirements, need all of the below|
|---|---|---|---|
|Founder(s) and team| <ul><li>Ever do something singular? Record of unusual achievement</li> <li>Best-in-the-world experience in the domain</li> <li>Punch-way-above-your-weight first hires + Depth of commitment to the problem (“would do this for a decade, and keep going even if funding never appeared”)</li></ul>|<ul><li>Combination of human/inhuman</li> <li>Presence of cognitive distortions of founders</li> <li>Reaction to intense pressure or strong criticism?</li> <li>Differentiated value proposition for talent</li> <li>If business shows early signs of success, can founders go the distance?</li></ul>|<ul><li>Trustworthy (i.e., will tell us when things are even a little broken)</li> <li>Can raise more money, or get business to profitability</li> <li>Completed background check</li> <li>In Bay Area or New York (and, if not, strong reason to believe we are the best possible investor)</li></ul>|
