Manual
======

Bloomberg Beta invests and builds companies from day zero. This is operating manual -- the same document we use to run our team -- open to any for comments and proposed changes.


## Why are we doing this at all?

Bloomberg Beta is a new fund, and (we hope) a new kind of fund. As we started working, we agreed to write down some of our practices -- mostly as notes to ourselves. Then we realized we spend a lot of time in meetings with entrepreneurs repeating these things, and that isn't a good use of our time or theirs. 

So, why not just share our practices, our operating manual. Then others can suggest changes, ask questions, or just read it and save time. Few things are so precious as the time of an entrepreneur -- we want you entrepreneurs to spend less of your time raising money, more of it on your product, or (maybe even) with your friends and family.

## How should you use this document?

If you’re an entrepreneur trying to understand if we’re a fit for you, we want this document to dispense with most of the questions of fact and many of the subjective questions of style, beliefs, and approach. Then, if you spend time with us, you can focus on getting past the basics.

We also want everyone to help make us better, the kind of investor you’d want to have -- and we think that exposing our approach in public is a way to get reactions and evolve.

**So here you are. When in doubt, RTFM. :)**
